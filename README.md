# Local Storage To-Do List

This is an example of how to create a drag-and-drop to-do list using HTML5's [Local Storage](http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html). I nicknamed the tool "LocalList" as you can see in the demo page. 

The demo page for this project was styled using my lightweight front-end framework [Concise](http://github.com/ConciseCSS/concise.css). 

This project started as a simple to-do list and then I started adding features like color-coding and drag-and-drop functionality. It's not finished, here are a list of things that still need to be fixed: 

- [ ] Proper commenting and descriptions for functions
- [ ] Style elements when dragging and dropping
- [ ] Save to cookie after dragging and dropping so changes are not overridden
- [ ] Fix notes export
